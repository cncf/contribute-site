## Award Categories

### Top Committer

Recognizes excellence in technical contributions to CNCF and its projects. The
CNCF Top Committer has made key commits to projects and, more importantly,
contributes in a way that benefits the project neutrally as a whole.

### Chop Wood Carry Water

Given to a community member who helps behind the scenes, dedicating countless
hours of their time to open source projects + completing often thankless tasks
for the ecosystem's benefit.

### Lorem Ipsum (prev. Top Documentarian)

Given to a community member who has shown excellence in documentation
contributions to CNCF and its projects. Excellent technical documentation is
one of the best ways projects can lower the barrier for contribution.

Groups. This individual has broad reach and significant impact in growing the
TAG ecosystem.
