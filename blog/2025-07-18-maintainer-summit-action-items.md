Greeting maintainers\! We have a few things that need your attention in order to get us in the mindset for KubeCon \+ CloudNativeCon NA. The first is taking the time to recognize our peers for their outstanding work in 2025\. The second item is making sure our swag is as awesome as you are. Third, submit your [Maintainer Summit CFP](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/#call-for-proposals) talks\!

**Deadline Summary**

* Maintainer Summit Contributor Award Nominations \- **August 15th**  
* T-shirt Design Deadline \- **August 8th** (announced August 12th)   
* [Maintainer Summit CFP](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/#call-for-proposals) \- **EOD July 21st\!\!\!\!**

**Contributor Awards 2025**

In previous years, the Kubernetes community recognized contributors who have gone above and beyond with the annual Kubernetes Contributor Awards. With the [creation](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/features-add-ons/maintainer-summit/#faqs) of a Maintainer Summit, we want to expand this to all graduated projects\! All graduated projects will now be able to nominate contributors to receive a physical award, usually in the form of a square canvas print. Projects may only submit for awards once per calendar year. That means if a project submits for Maintainer Summit EU 2026, they cannot submit again for NA 2026\.

**Nominations**  
Graduated projects will be nominating individuals for the awards. Projects must submit nominations by **August 15th**\! This is a way to highlight individuals who have had a major impact on your project and exemplify the values of our communities. 

* Larger graduated projects with multiple SIGs are encouraged to nominate 2-3 people per SIG/WG  
* Smaller graduated projects should target 2-3 nominees  
* Here are the [Ideas and Values Guidelines](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/awards/playbook.md#ideals-and-values) from Kubernetes that are useful in helping select nominees. 

Please nominate contributors doing outstanding work in your projects by [filling out this form](https://forms.gle/eYKezEWhvecLVQEKA). The deadline for KubeCon \+ CloudNativeCon NA (Atlanta) is **August 15th**\!

**KubeCon NA Maintainer Summit T-Shirt Design**  
It’s time to flex that creative muscle\! For this Maintainer Summit we want to solicit designs for our attendee t-shirts\! Anyone **eligible to attend the maintainer summit** can submit art ideas, and the designs will be chosen by this summit’s program chairs.

Design submissions should follow these guidelines:

* **Vector (svg) format.** [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) is a free, open source tool that can be used to create vector graphics.  
* **Use 3 colors (5 max).** The cost of printing increases with each color added. The fewer colors you use, the more affordable it will be for the community to have swag produced.  
* **The [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md)** **applies**. Submissions that do not follow the code of conduct will not be considered.  
* **No AI**. AI-generated image content is not permitted in any form due to the likelihood of infringement. Do not use AI-generated imagery in any way in your design.

The deadline to submit is August 8th, and the winner will be chosen and informed August 12th. 

Submit your awesome T-Shirt designs by filling out this [form](https://forms.gle/xhqraWy1wcwewv9R6).

**KubeCon NA Maintainer Summit CFP**  
This one is pretty self explanatory. The CFP closes EOD Monday, July 21st. If you haven’t submitted a talk, and want to, now’s the time to panic and pull something together\!
