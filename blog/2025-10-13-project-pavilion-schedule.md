### Graphics, Signage, and Stickers

:::info Custom Materials Policy
Custom graphics, banners, and tablecloths are not permitted in the Project

:::

**Kiosk Logo:** The project's horizontal color logo from the
[CNCF artwork repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork) was used for signage.
If the required logo was not available in the repository at the time signage was
ordered, CNCF staff determined which logo to use.

**Stickers:** Stickers will be provided for all projects participating in Project
Kiosks. The size and design of stickers may vary as inventory is carried over
from previous events and multiple manufacturers are used. For new sticker orders,
the project's stacked color logo from the CNCF artwork repository was used. If
the required logo was not available at the time stickers were ordered, CNCF staff
determined which logo to use.
