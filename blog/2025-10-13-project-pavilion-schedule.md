## Reminders About Your Kiosk

### Shipping

Please contact
[ProjectsAtKubeCon@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:ProjectsAtKubeCon@linuxfoundation.org)
for shipping instructions. All shipments must arrive no later than **Monday,
November 3**.

### Security and Onsite Storage

Please do not leave valuable items unattended at your kiosk at any time,
including setup, dismantling, and open hours. Please take valuables such as
laptops to your hotel room.

Limited storage space will be available for projects to store boxes or giveaways
during the conference. A small storage room will be located in the exhibit hall.
Each project is limited to **two (2) boxes**. The storage room will be available
throughout the conference starting on Monday, November 10 during move-in hours.
It will be shared by all projects and sponsors on a first come first serve
basis. Storage space cannot be reserved. Please be considerate of others and
stack your boxes to take up as little space as possible. Do not use the storage
room for personal belongings, luggage, or valuables.

Please visit the exhibitor services desk in the exhibit hall for the access code
to the storage room. All items must be removed from the storage room by **4:00
PM on Thursday, November 13**. Any left-behind items may be discarded at the
project's expense.

Neither CNCF, the Linux Foundation, Georgia World Congress Center, Freeman, or
their employees, staff, or third-party vendors will be held liable for lost or
stolen items.

### Staffing Your Kiosk

The kiosk must be staffed by Maintainers, Contributors, or Ambassadors of the
project for the full duration of your assigned showcase hours.

If the project anticipates NOT being able to staff the kiosk for your assigned
shift(s), please let us know as soon as possible. If the kiosk is not staffed
during the full shift(s), you will receive a notification from the CNCF staff
and your kiosk shift eligibility will be reduced for future events.

We do not offer complimentary passes to projects hosting a Project Kiosk. This
has been a practice of the event since 2017. CNCF provides need-based
scholarships, however, the application deadline has passed, and no additional
funds are available.

We encourage you to share your use cases about your projects and your
organization's involvement in the CNCF. The Project Pavilion is a vendor-neutral
space; projects are prohibited from giving sales pitches to attendees about a
product or company. If sales pitches are being conducted, CNCF reserves the
right to request that the project leave and to deny future requests for a
project kiosk.

### Graphics/Signage/Stickers

Custom graphics, banners, and tablecloths are not permitted in the Project
Pavilion.

**Kiosk Logo:** The project's horizontal color logo from the CNCF artwork
repository was used for signage. If the required logo was not available in the
repository at the time signage was ordered, CNCF staff determined which logo to
use.

**Stickers:** Stickers will be provided for all projects participating in
Project Kiosks. Please note that the size and design of the stickers provided
may vary as we carry over inventory from previous events and use multiple
manufacturers. For new sticker orders, the project's stacked color logo from the
CNCF artwork repository was used. If the required logo was not available in the
repository at the time stickers were ordered, CNCF staff determined which logo
to use.
