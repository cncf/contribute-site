Greetings maintainers! We have some exciting updates about resources newly available to you and your projects.

And please make sure to take the [maintainer survey](http://maintainers.cncf.io)! This is your chance to tell us how we're doing, gauge your understanding of the benefits of hosting a project at the CNCF, and to help influence our priorities in 2026.

**New services since the last Maintainer Summit at KubeCon London**

**GitHub Copilot** - We are excited to announce an expanded partnership with GitHub to provide free Copilot Enterprise licenses to CNCF project maintainers. This benefit is part of a limited pilot program and will be rolling out in the coming weeks. Eligibility will be validated against the list at [maintainers.cncf.io](http://maintainers.cncf.io), so please ensure your project's information is up to date.

**Docker Sponsored Open Source Program** - Through the [Docker Sponsored Open Source Program](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2025/09/18/cncf-expands-infrastructure-support-for-project-maintainers-through-partnership-with-docker/), project maintainers gain access to upgraded registry, security, and support services. These include unlimited Docker Hub image pulls, sponsored OSS status, Docker Scout for vulnerability analysis, automated image builds, usage metrics, and streamlined support. Request access via the Service Desk.

**Akamai/Linode** - [Akamai pledged $700K in cloud credits to the CNCF for project use](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/11/05/akamai-builds-cloud-native-resilience-cloud-credits-to-power-cncf-projects/). Projects can now request access to onboard Linode. This platform provides another alternative to [Equinix which is due to sunset later this year](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/06/04/thank-you-equinix-metal-the-cncf-community-bids-farewell-to-the-bare-metal-cluster/). Oracle Cloud credits also continue to be available, particularly for [AI workloads on ARM and bare metal deployments](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/02/02/oracle-oci-credits-are-now-available-to-cncf-projects-here-is-what-you-need-to-know/). Request access to either service via the Service Desk.

**LFX Insights** - The latest version of [Insights was launched at Open Source Summit in June](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/). You can get deeper context on the health of your project by analyzing its [velocity, contributor dependency, and organizational reliance](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/k8s). You can also add a badge to your repos, embed charts in your READMEs and presentations. If you see any data issues (such as new repos not onboarded or other missing data, you can open up issues on the [Insights GitHub repo](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/insights). Check it out\!

**LFX Project Control Center** - [The CNCF has moved its community calendar to PCC](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/10/23/cncf-embraces-lfx-self-service-for-calendar-management/) which now enables maintainers to publish and update their own entries on the [CNCF community calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/). This eliminates a project and staff bottleneck as entries were previously handled as Service Desk tickets. PCC also recently added an often-requested feature: the automatic upload of project meetings to the project's designated YouTube channel. Projects have control over any video changes before publication.

[**ask.cncf.io**](http://ask.cncf.io) - ask.cncf.io is an AI assistant built with Dosu designed to answer questions about the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem, including projects, governance, events, and contributor information. This is not a general LLM chatbot. It only contains information from official repositories and documentation across the CNCF. Give it a try and come back often to see how it improves over time.

[**contribute.cncf.io**](http://contribute.cncf.io) - We've relaunched the [contribute.cncf.io](http://contribute.cncf.io) site 🎉. This site serves as the primary place for maintainers to learn about what benefits they have as a CNCF project and helps expand our funnel of new maintainers for your projects. You can also [submit pull requests](https://github.com/cncf/contribute-site) to improve content.

**Reminder about other services available to you**

* The [contribute.cncf.io resource page](https://contribute.cncf.io/resources/) is up to date with everything that's available to you.
