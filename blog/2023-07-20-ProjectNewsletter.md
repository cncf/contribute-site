## üìä Etcd Usage Survey

:::info Project Survey
The etcd project wants to hear from you!
:::

Data compiled from the survey will help guide the project's strategic direction and prioritize work, particularly around support for uses outside of Kubernetes.

## üîÄ GitHub Merge Queues

:::note Now Generally Available
GitHub Merge Queues are now [generally available](https://github.blog/2023-07-12-github-merge-queue-is-generally-available/)!
:::

The merge queue workflow allows busy teams to land changes into the main branch more efficiently. It does this by creating an independent branch of each approved change which is then added to a queue. As an item is added to the queue it is branched along with the upstream changes that are ahead of that merge in the queue, allowing for continuous merging while enforcing all the status checks.

## üì¶ Artifact Hub Expands Artifact Support

:::tip Discover More Artifacts
Artifacthub.io is an indexer of cloud native deployment artifacts.
:::

It doesn't host these artifacts, but allows projects to index their artifacts so that it's more discoverable by users. This is handy if you publish your artifacts in multiple registries, or have a collection that you'd like to recommend to your users. Each entry also includes a social integration card so that you can embed the information in your README or website.

**Supported Artifact Types:**

Over the past year Artifact Hub has gained support for more than just container images. You can also register:
- Helm charts and plugins
- Falco configurations
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Gatekeeper policies
- OLM operators
- Tinkerbell actions
- kubectl plugins
- Tekton tasks and pipelines
- KEDA scalers
- CoreDNS plugins
- Keptn integrations
- Container images
- Kubewarden policies
- Kyverno policies
- Knative client plugins
- Backstage plugins
- Argo templates
- KubeArmor policies
