## ‚öñÔ∏è HashiCorp Licensing Changes

:::caution Data Collection
HashiCorp has changed several products to the BUSL license. If your project uses HashiCorp products as a dependency, please let us know!
:::

Please note: We're gathering data on our usage. Nothing more.

[Submit Information on GitHub](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/issues/617)

## ‚úàÔ∏è Travel Scholarships

:::tip Dan Kohn Travel Scholarship
If you are a maintainer that is unable to come to KubeCon for financial reasons (such as corporate travel pullback), please apply for the Dan Kohn Travel Scholarship.
:::

This is here for us to grow as well as maintain the community that we have. Maintainers have made KubeCon what it is, and it is not the same event without you there.

**Personal note from Jeefy:** Never feel bad asking for help. It's the least the CNCF can do given the hard work and community building you all do.

**Deadline:** In-person applications close Sunday, September 3 (11:59 PM Pacific Time)
