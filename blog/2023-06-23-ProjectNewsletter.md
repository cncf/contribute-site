## üìä DevStats Affiliation

:::tip Data Source
Ever wondered where DevStats affiliations come from?
:::

They're in these repositories:
- [github.com/cncf/gitdm](https://github.com/cncf/gitdm)
- [openprofile.dev](https://openprofile.dev)

These may be useful to you! If you haven't updated these recently, these affiliations are what DevStats looks for.

## üîê TOC Meeting with AdaLogics

If you're curious about the goals + processes for security audits, the Technical Oversight Meeting for 6/20 might be useful for you! This is a recorded meeting with Adalogics and some project maintainers.

## üëÆ New Sheriff in Town - Repo Access Permissions

:::caution Important Change
Sheriff is being used to centralize repo access control for the CNCF org on GitHub.
:::

When you want to grant access to your project repos to maintainers and collaborators, please submit a pull request to update the config.yaml file in the [cncf/people](https://github.com/cncf/people) repo.

Sheriff runs once per hour from a GitHub Action on cncf/people, and it will undo any changes to repo permissions that are made via a repo's settings.yml file. Using Sheriff makes it easy for us to review who has access to all community repos in the CNCF org. Sheriff also allows us to structure our teams to reflect team roles and Sheriff teams are cross platform.
