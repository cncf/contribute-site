## Update Your Project Logos

The CNCF Events Team pulls project logos from the [CNCF artwork repository](https://github.com/cncf/artwork/tree/main/projects) for signage and stickers. Please be sure to upload your project’s high-resolution *stacked and horizontal color logos at least 8 weeks before the event*. If the required file is unavailable in the repository or is not high resolution, CNCF staff will determine which file to use.

## Call for Kubernetes AI Conformance applications and reference architectures

Late last year, the [Kubernetes AI Conformance program officially launched](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/08/01/help-us-build-the-kubernetes-conformance-for-ai/) and the interest and response has been overwhelming! Many thanks to our initial batch of contributors and conformance program participants.

With Kubernetes 1.35 having launched, it's a perfect time to [submit your K8s AI Conformance application here](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance).

Willing to talk about your use of Cloud Native projects in the AI training and inference space? We'd love to hear from you! Please email [projects@cncf.io](mailto:projects@cncf.io)

## See you next month
