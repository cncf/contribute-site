## üó∫Ô∏è KubeCon for Maintainers!

:::info Maintainer-Focused Activities
There will be several maintainer-focused activities at KubeCon, be sure to check them out!
:::

**Featured Sessions:**

- **Keynote:** Building a Sustainable CNCF Project Contributor Base by Dawn Foster
- **Panel discussion:** TAG Contributor Strategy: What We Get Out of It (and You Could Too!) with Dawn Foster, Nate Waddington, Dave Sudia, Josh Berkus, and Catherine Paganini
- **TAG Contributor Strategy kiosk** in the project pavilion: swing by, meet the team, and learn about the different resources the TAG created for maintainers ([learn more about the TAG here](https://github.com/cncf/tag-contributor-strategy))
- **Maintainers Circle:** Engaging the End User Community
  - Maintainers of the OTel project mostly come from vendors that ingest telemetry data, but the challenge they've had is that most people coming to the project from outside are end users using OpenTelemetry to instrument their code. They'll talk about how they engaged those community members, and provide a structure for examining your constituency and how to engage the people in your community who aren't contributors.
  - **When:** Wednesday April 19, 11-12
  - **Where:** Rooms D203-204 (not on Sched)
