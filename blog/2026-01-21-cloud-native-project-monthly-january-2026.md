Welcome to the January 2026 edition of the Cloud Native Project Monthly (CNPM) Newsletter.

In 2025 we saw continued [project growth](https://www.cncf.io/project-metrics/), with the TOC accepting an additional six projects to close out the year. The speed at which projects join the CNCF and advance through levels has improved thanks to better processes, and we've expanded the variety of services available to maintainers through new partnerships with providers. We are committed to serving you even better in 2026.

Please take a moment to complete the [2H 2025 Maintainer Survey](https://maintainers-survey.cncf.io). Your feedback is vital for us to serve you better this year. The survey will close on January 30th, so please respond as soon as you can!

## Google Summer of Code 2026 opportunities

CNCF is planning on being a Mentoring Organization again this year for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and can help projects looking to participate in the program. This is a fantastic opportunity to increase your project's contributor community and get valuable work done!

This year, GSoC is actively looking to bring in more projects in the areas of Security and AI/ML.

[GSoC 2026 Announcement](https://groups.google.com/g/google-summer-of-code-discuss/c/D-aU3nHnGBQ/m/VU7lwF_MBQAJ)  
[CNCF GSoC 2026 ideas worksheet](https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/main/programs/summerofcode/2026.md)

Key dates:

* Organizations application period: *Monday, Jan 19, to Tuesday, Feb 3, 2026*
* CNCF Project proposals submissions recommendation: *Wednesday Jan 14, 2026*
* Note, We’re past this now, and only have a handful of proposals. We’d like a few more, so if you’d like to participate, now’s a good time to add an idea. The more proposals we have, the stronger our org application will be.

## Please take the Maintainer Survey

To help guide the CNCF's efforts in supporting our projects, we regularly collect feedback from maintainers on their experience at the CNCF. Please help us help you by filling out the 2H25 edition of the [CNCF Maintainers Survey](https://maintainers-survey.cncf.io).

This is your chance to tell us how we're doing, gauge your understanding of the benefits of hosting a project at the CNCF, and influence our priorities in 2026. It should take no more than a couple of minutes of your time. Thanks in advance!

## Call for Kubernetes AI Conformance applications and reference architectures

Late last year, the [Kubernetes AI Conformance program officially launched](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/08/01/help-us-build-the-kubernetes-conformance-for-ai/) and the interest and response has been overwhelming! Many thanks to our initial batch of contributors and conformance program participants.

With Kubernetes 1.35 having launched, it's a perfect time to [submit your K8s AI Conformance application here](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-ai-conformance).

Willing to talk about your use of Cloud Native projects in the AI training and inference space? We'd love to hear from you! Please email <projects@cncf.io>

## GitHub Copilot guidance

We are excited to officially roll out GitHub Copilot Enterprise to CNCF project maintainers!

[This post outlines the specific features available to you, best practices for sustainable usage, and the step-by-step process to request access today](https://contribute.cncf.io/blog/2025/12/16/github-copilot-enterprise-for-maintainers).

## Docker Hardened Images are now free for projects

Docker announced that they are making Docker Hardened Images free to all developers.

DHI provides maintainers of CNCF projects with secure, minimal, continuously maintained, base container images that reduce vulnerabilities and attack surfaces while fitting into existing workflows and improving supply-chain security overall.

Many CNCF projects can already be found in the DHI catalog, and giving the broader community access to secure, well-maintained building blocks helps us strengthen the software supply chain together.

[Learn how to get started in this blog post](https://contribute.cncf.io/blog/2026/01/21/docker-hardened-images-for-cncf-projects).

### CNCF Projects Calendar Migration: Move your project’s meetings to LFX PCC for Self-Service Scheduling

As we head into 2026, we encourage any remaining projects to transition to the **LFX Project Control Center (PCC)** to take full advantage of our new self-service calendar system. With the legacy Google Calendar system now sunset, moving to PCC is the best way to ensure your community meetings remain visible and organized.

By switching to PCC, maintainers gain direct autonomy over their schedules, including:

* **Automatic recording uploads** to your project’s YouTube channel.
* **Direct control** via LFX, removing the need for Service Desk tickets for simple updates.

If you haven’t made the move yet, please reach out via the [CNCF Service Desk](https://servicedesk.cncf.io/). We are here to support your transition path and ensure a smooth setup.

For a quick walkthrough, check out this [short video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OKNR_QHGXgM) on managing meetings within PCC.
