# Redirects from old cncf-contribute.netlify.app to new contribute-cncf-io.netlify.app
# This file handles migration from the archived cncf/contribute repository
# to the new contribute-site repository
#
# The old site (Hugo-based) had a simple structure:
# - /contributors/ - Main contributor information page
# - /contributors/projects - List of all CNCF projects with contribution info
#
# The new site (Docusaurus-based) has reorganized this content:
# - /contributors/ - Main contributor information (similar content)
# - /contributors/getting-started/ - Getting started guide for new contributors
# - Project information moved to CNCF Landscape (landscape.cncf.io)

# Old projects page redirect
# The old /contributors/projects page contained a comprehensive list of all CNCF projects
# with contribution information. This is now better served by:
# 1. The official CNCF Landscape for project discovery: https://landscape.cncf.io
# 2. The getting-started guide for contribution workflow: /contributors/getting-started/
# We redirect to getting-started as it's the most relevant for the "how to contribute" intent
