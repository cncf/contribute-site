# Redirects for contribute.cncf.io
# This file handles redirects from multiple legacy sites:
# 1. Old cncf-contribute.netlify.app (archived cncf/contribute repo)
# 2. Old contribute.cncf.io (tag-contributor-strategy/website)
#
# The new site (Docusaurus-based) has reorganized and consolidated content from both sources.
# New site takes precedence where there are path conflicts.
