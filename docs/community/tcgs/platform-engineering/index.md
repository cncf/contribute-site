# Platform Engineering Technical Community Group

The Platform Engineering Technical Community Group (Platform Engineering TCG) brings together practitioners building and operating internal developer platforms. The group focuses on patterns, practices, and tools for creating platforms that improve developer experience, productivity, and organizational efficiency.

## Mission

The Platform Engineering TCG aims to:

- Foster collaboration among platform engineering practitioners
- Share patterns and practices for building internal developer platforms
- Discuss platform architecture, tooling, and implementation strategies
- Explore platform team structures and organizational patterns
- Coordinate community efforts around platform engineering standards
- Support the growth of the platform engineering discipline

## Focus Areas

The Platform Engineering TCG discusses topics including:

- **Platform Architecture** - Designing scalable, reliable internal developer platforms
- **Developer Experience** - Self-service capabilities, golden paths, and developer portals
- **Platform Teams** - Team structures, responsibilities, and organizational models
- **Infrastructure as a Product** - Product thinking applied to internal platforms
- **Abstraction Layers** - Balancing simplicity and flexibility in platform abstractions
- **Platform Tools** - CI/CD, observability, security, and other platform capabilities
- **Governance** - Policy enforcement, compliance, and security controls
- **Migration Strategies** - Moving to platform models from existing infrastructure
- **Metrics and Success** - Measuring platform adoption, developer satisfaction, and productivity

## Meetings

## Leadership

As a Technical Community Group, the Platform Engineering TCG is organized by community volunteers who facilitate meetings and coordinate activities. Leadership is informal and community-driven.

## Current Activities

The Platform Engineering TCG facilitates:

- **Knowledge Sharing** - Presentations from organizations about their platform engineering journeys
- **Pattern Documentation** - Collecting and documenting common platform patterns
- **Tool Evaluations** - Community reviews of platform engineering tools
- **Case Studies** - Real-world examples of platform implementations
- **Best Practices** - Collaborative development of platform engineering guidance
- **Community Building** - Connecting platform engineers across organizations

## Platform Engineering and CNCF

Platform Engineering intersects with many CNCF technologies and groups:

- **TAG Developer Experience** - Overlapping focus on developer productivity
- **TAG Infrastructure** - Platform infrastructure considerations
- **CNCF Projects** - Many CNCF projects are used as platform building blocks

## Getting Involved

### Join the Community

1. Join the Platform Engineering TCG channel on [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io)
2. Subscribe to the mailing list (if available)
3. Attend TCG meetings (check the [CNCF calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/))
4. Introduce yourself and share your platform engineering experiences

### Participate

There are many ways to participate:

- **Share your platform** - Present your organization's platform engineering approach
- **Discuss challenges** - Bring questions and problems to the community
- **Contribute patterns** - Document patterns and practices you've discovered
- **Review proposals** - Provide feedback on platform architectures and designs
- **Connect** - Network with other platform engineers
- **Organize** - Lead initiatives or working sessions within the group

### Present at a Meeting

To present at a Platform Engineering TCG meeting:

1. Propose your topic in the Slack channel
2. Coordinate with the meeting organizers on scheduling
3. Prepare your presentation (case studies and demos are particularly welcome)
4. Share your experience with the community

## Key Topics of Interest

### Golden Paths

Creating well-documented, supported paths for common development scenarios that make it easy for developers to do the right thing.

### Platform as a Product

Treating internal platforms as products with users (developers), product management, and continuous improvement.

### Developer Portals

Self-service interfaces that allow developers to discover, provision, and manage platform capabilities.

### Platform Teams

Organizational structures and practices for effective platform teams, including their relationship with application teams.

## Related CNCF Projects
