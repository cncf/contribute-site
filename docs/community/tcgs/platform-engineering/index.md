# Platform Engineering Technical Community Group

The Platform Engineering Technical Community Group (TCG) focuses on platform engineering practices, tools, and patterns that enable development teams to self-service their infrastructure needs while maintaining consistency, security, and governance across the organization.

## Mission

The Platform Engineering TCG serves as a community rallying point for discussing, sharing knowledge, and coordinating initiatives related to building and operating internal developer platforms. We aim to help organizations deliver better developer experiences while maintaining operational excellence.

## Focus Areas

### Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)

Exploring the design, implementation, and operation of internal platforms:

- **Platform Architecture**: Designing platforms that balance flexibility and standardization
- **Service Catalogs**: Creating discoverable, self-service capabilities
- **Platform APIs**: Designing intuitive interfaces for platform services
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Supporting multiple teams and workloads safely

### Golden Paths

Establishing and maintaining preferred patterns:

- **Paved Roads**: Creating recommended paths that are easy to follow
- **Template Libraries**: Reusable templates for common use cases
- **Best Practices**: Documenting and sharing proven patterns
- **Guardrails**: Balancing freedom with necessary constraints

### Self-Service Capabilities

Enabling developer autonomy through platform features:

- **Environment Provisioning**: On-demand creation of development, test, and production environments
- **CI/CD Integration**: Streamlined build, test, and deployment pipelines
- **Service Dependencies**: Easy provisioning of databases, caches, message queues, etc.
- **Observability Tools**: Built-in monitoring, logging, and tracing

### Platform as a Product

Treating internal platforms as products:

- **Product Thinking**: Applying product management principles to platforms
- **User Research**: Understanding developer needs and pain points
- **Metrics and KPIs**: Measuring platform adoption and effectiveness
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous improvement based on user input
- **Platform Teams**: Organizing and operating platform teams effectively

### Developer Experience

Optimizing the experience for platform users:

- **Portal Interfaces**: User-friendly web portals for platform interaction
- **CLI Tools**: Command-line interfaces for developer workflows
- **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive, and up-to-date docs
- **Onboarding**: Helping new teams adopt the platform quickly
- **Support Models**: Providing help and resolving issues effectively

### Platform Engineering Practices

Operational aspects of running platforms:

- **GitOps**: Managing platform configuration through Git
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Declarative infrastructure management
- **Policy as Code**: Automated policy enforcement
- **Security Integration**: Baking security into platform workflows
- **Cost Management**: Visibility and control over platform costs

## Getting Involved

The Platform Engineering TCG welcomes participation from anyone building or using internal developer platforms:

### Join the Community

- **CNCF Community Groups**: Find us on [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io)
- **CNCF Slack**: Join [slack.cncf.io](https://slack.cncf.io) and look for platform engineering channels
- **Meetings**: Check community.cncf.io for meeting schedules and join links

### Contribute

- **Share Your Platform**: Present your platform architecture and lessons learned
- **Case Studies**: Document real-world platform engineering examples
- **Participate in Initiatives**: Help create guides, reference architectures, or maturity models
- **Ask Questions**: Learn from others facing similar challenges
- **Provide Feedback**: Shape the direction of platform engineering practices

### Topics for Discussion

Areas where community input is valuable:

- Platform team structures and staffing models
- Technology choices for platform components (Backstage, Crossplane, Kratix, etc.)
- Measuring platform ROI and developer productivity
- Balancing standardization with team autonomy
- Legacy application migration to platforms
- Platform federation across multiple clouds
- Integration patterns with existing tools and processes

## Organizers

Technical Community Groups are led by community organizers who facilitate meetings, coordinate activities, and ensure the group delivers value to participants.

To become an organizer or learn more about current organizers, check the group's page on [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io) or reach out via the CNCF Slack.

## Use Cases

Platform engineering addresses various organizational needs:

### Startup Scaling

- Establishing patterns as the organization grows
- Avoiding technical debt from ad-hoc solutions
- Enabling teams to move fast with confidence

### Enterprise Modernization

- Standardizing across diverse tech stacks
- Improving developer productivity
- Reducing operational complexity

### Multi-Cloud Management

- Providing consistent experience across clouds
- Managing complexity of hybrid environments
- Avoiding cloud vendor lock-in

### Compliance and Governance

- Enforcing security policies automatically
- Maintaining audit trails
- Meeting regulatory requirements

## Evolution and Future

As a Technical Community Group, the Platform Engineering TCG may evolve based on community needs:

- **Current State**: Discussion and knowledge-sharing forum
- **Near Term**: Deliver initiatives like maturity models, best practices guides, or reference architectures
- **Long Term**: Potentially evolve into a TAG or subproject if sustained value and formal oversight is needed

The community drives the direction and pace of this evolution.
