# Artificial Intelligence Technical Community Group

The Artificial Intelligence Technical Community Group (TCG) focuses on artificial intelligence and machine learning in cloud native environments, exploring AI/ML workloads, frameworks, infrastructure requirements, and best practices for running AI systems at scale.

## Mission

The AI TCG serves as a community rallying point for discussing, sharing knowledge, and coordinating initiatives related to artificial intelligence and machine learning in the cloud native ecosystem. We aim to bridge the gap between traditional AI/ML practices and cloud native architectures.

## Focus Areas

### AI/ML Infrastructure

Exploring infrastructure requirements and patterns for running AI/ML workloads in cloud native environments:

- **Compute Resources**: GPU/TPU scheduling, resource allocation, and optimization
- **Storage Solutions**: Managing large datasets, model artifacts, and training data
- **Networking**: High-performance networking for distributed training
- **Resource Management**: Efficient utilization of expensive AI/ML hardware

### Model Lifecycle Management

Covering the full lifecycle of machine learning models:

- **Training at Scale**: Distributed training patterns and frameworks
- **Model Serving**: Inference deployment patterns and performance optimization
- **Model Versioning**: Managing model versions and experiments
- **Model Monitoring**: Performance tracking and drift detection

### MLOps Practices

Best practices for operationalizing machine learning:

- **CI/CD for ML**: Automated testing, validation, and deployment pipelines
- **Experiment Tracking**: Managing experiments, hyperparameters, and results
- **Feature Stores**: Managing and serving features for training and inference
- **Model Registry**: Centralized model artifact management

### AI Governance

Addressing governance, compliance, and ethical considerations:

- **Model Explainability**: Making AI decisions transparent and understandable
- **Bias Detection**: Identifying and mitigating bias in models and data
- **Compliance**: Meeting regulatory requirements for AI systems
- **Security**: Protecting models, data, and inference endpoints

### Cloud Native AI Patterns

Exploring patterns specific to cloud native AI:

- **Containerized Workflows**: Packaging AI/ML workloads in containers
- **Kubernetes for AI**: Leveraging Kubernetes for AI/ML orchestration
- **Serverless AI**: Event-driven and serverless AI architectures
- **Edge AI**: Deploying models to edge devices and environments

## Getting Involved

The AI TCG welcomes participation from anyone interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning in cloud native environments:

### Join the Community

- **CNCF Community Groups**: Find us on [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io)
- **CNCF Slack**: Join [slack.cncf.io](https://slack.cncf.io) and look for AI-related channels
- **Meetings**: Check community.cncf.io for meeting schedules and join links

### Contribute

- **Share Experiences**: Present your AI/ML use cases and lessons learned
- **Participate in Initiatives**: Help with white papers, guides, or other deliverables
- **Ask Questions**: Bring your challenges and learn from the community
- **Provide Feedback**: Help shape the direction of AI in cloud native

### Topics for Discussion

Some areas where community input is valuable:

- Kubernetes operators for AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.)
- GPU sharing and scheduling strategies
- Cost optimization for AI/ML workloads
- Data pipeline patterns for ML
- Real-time inference architectures
- Federated learning in cloud native environments
- Integration with CNCF projects (Knative, KubeFlow, etc.)

## Organizers

Technical Community Groups are led by community organizers who facilitate meetings, coordinate activities, and ensure the group delivers value to participants.

To become an organizer or learn more about current organizers, check the group's page on [community.cncf.io](https://community.cncf.io) or reach out via the CNCF Slack.

## Evolution and Future

As a Technical Community Group, the AI TCG may evolve based on community needs:

- **Current State**: Discussion and knowledge-sharing forum
- **Near Term**: Deliver initiatives like best practices guides or reference architectures
- **Long Term**: Potentially evolve into a TAG if sustained value and formal oversight is needed

The community drives the direction and pace of this evolution.
