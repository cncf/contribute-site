# Artificial Intelligence Technical Community Group

The Artificial Intelligence Technical Community Group (AI TCG) brings together practitioners, researchers, and organizations working on AI and machine learning in cloud native environments. The group focuses on the unique challenges and opportunities of running AI/ML workloads at scale using cloud native technologies.

## Mission

The AI TCG aims to:

- Foster collaboration among practitioners working with AI/ML in cloud native environments
- Share best practices for deploying and operating AI/ML workloads
- Discuss infrastructure requirements and challenges for AI/ML systems
- Explore emerging technologies and patterns in cloud native AI
- Coordinate community efforts around AI/ML tooling and frameworks
- Identify gaps and opportunities for standardization

## Focus Areas

The AI TCG discusses topics including:

- **AI/ML Infrastructure** - Hardware acceleration (GPUs, TPUs), distributed training, inference serving
- **Model Management** - Model versioning, deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management
- **Data Pipelines** - Data ingestion, preprocessing, feature stores, and data versioning
- **MLOps** - CI/CD for ML, experiment tracking, model governance
- **Scalability** - Distributed training, model serving at scale, resource optimization
- **Edge AI** - Running AI/ML workloads at the edge with cloud native technologies
- **AI/ML Frameworks** - Integration of frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX with cloud native platforms
- **AI Security** - Securing AI/ML pipelines, model security, and privacy considerations

## Meetings

### Regular Meetings

- **Schedule**: Check the [CNCF Public Calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/) for current meeting times

## Leadership

As a Technical Community Group, the AI TCG is organized by community volunteers who facilitate meetings and coordinate activities. Leadership is informal and community-driven.

## Current Activities

The AI TCG facilitates:

- **Knowledge Sharing** - Presentations and discussions from community members
- **Use Case Studies** - Real-world examples of running AI/ML in cloud native environments
- **Tool Evaluations** - Community reviews of AI/ML tools and platforms
- **Best Practice Development** - Collaborative documentation of patterns and practices
- **Community Building** - Connecting practitioners across organizations

## Getting Involved

### Join the Community
