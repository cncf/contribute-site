# Technical Community Groups (TCGs)

Technical Community Groups (TCGs) are topic or domain-focused groups that serve
as rallying points for community members to discuss, share knowledge, and
coordinate potential future initiatives. TCGs provide a lightweight structure
for community collaboration without the formality and overhead of a TAG.

## What are TCGs?

TCGs are designed to:

- Foster discussion and knowledge sharing on specific topics
- Coordinate community interest and activities
- Serve as incubation spaces for potential future initiatives or TAGs
- Enable community members to collaborate informally
- Provide a forum for exploring emerging technologies and practices

## TCGs vs TAGs

| Aspect           | Technical Community Group (TCG)          | Technical Advisory Group (TAG)                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**    | Lightweight, informal                    | Formal governance, elected leadership           |
| **Scope**        | Topic-focused discussion and exploration | Defined technical domain with deliverables      |
| **Reporting**    | Informal updates to TOC                  | Regular reporting to TOC                        |
| **Leadership**   | Community organizers                     | Elected Chairs and Tech Leads                   |
| **Deliverables** | Optional, community-driven               | Required outputs (whitepapers, standards, etc.) |
| **Formation**    | Community-initiated, TOC acknowledged    | TOC vote required                               |

## Current TCGs

CNCF currently has three active Technical Community Groups:

### Artificial Intelligence TCG

**Focus**: Cloud native AI/ML workloads and infrastructure

The Artificial Intelligence TCG brings together practitioners working on AI and
machine learning in cloud native environments. The group discusses challenges,
best practices, and emerging technologies related to running AI/ML workloads at
scale.

**Resources**:

### Platform Engineering TCG

**Focus**: Internal developer platforms and platform engineering practices

The Platform Engineering TCG focuses on building and operating internal
developer platforms that improve developer productivity and experience. The
group shares patterns, tools, and practices for platform engineering.

**Resources**:

### Software Supply Chain Security TCG

**Focus**: Software supply chain security challenges and solutions

The Software Supply Chain Security TCG addresses the growing importance of
securing the software supply chain. The group discusses threats, best practices,
tools, and standards for supply chain security.

## TCG Structure

TCGs typically have:

- **Organizers**: Community members who facilitate meetings and coordinate
  activities
- **Participants**: Anyone interested in the topic
- **Communication Channels**: Slack channels and mailing lists
- **Meetings**: Regular virtual meetings (frequency varies by TCG)

## Getting Involved

### Join a TCG

To join a TCG:

1. Visit the TCG's page (linked above) to find their communication channels
2. Join their Slack channel and mailing list
3. Attend meetings to introduce yourself and learn about current discussions
4. Participate in discussions and share your experiences

### Contribute

TCGs welcome contributions in many forms:

- Share your experiences and use cases
- Participate in discussions and provide feedback
- Present on relevant topics at TCG meetings
- Help document patterns and best practices
- Organize or lead initiatives within the TCG

### Propose a New TCG

To propose a new Technical Community Group:

1. Gather initial community interest (potential organizers and participants)
2. Define the scope and focus of the proposed TCG
3. Create a proposal following the
   [CNCF Technical Group Governance](../governance/tech-group-governance.md)
   guidelines
4. Open an issue in the [CNCF TOC repository](https://github.com/cncf/toc) with
   your proposal
5. Present your proposal to the TOC for acknowledgment

## TCG Governance

TCGs operate under the
[CNCF Technical Group Governance](../governance/tech-group-governance.md)
framework, specifically under the Community Groups section. Key aspects include:

- **Formation**: TCGs are community-initiated and acknowledged by the TOC
- **Evolution**: TCGs may evolve into TAGs if they develop sufficient scope and
  community
- **Flexibility**: TCGs have flexibility in structure and operations based on
  community needs
- **Autonomy**: TCGs are largely self-organizing with minimal overhead

## Communication

### General TCG Information

For questions about TCGs:

- Open an issue in the [CNCF TOC repository](https://github.com/cncf/toc)
- Ask in the `#toc` channel on [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com)
- Contact individual TCGs through their communication channels
