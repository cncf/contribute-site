# CNCF Governance

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) operates under a comprehensive governance structure designed to support the cloud native ecosystem. This section provides information about CNCF's technical governance framework and processes.

## Overview

CNCF's technical governance is structured to enable effective collaboration while maintaining project quality and community health. The governance framework includes policies, procedures, and guidelines that help maintain the integrity and direction of cloud native computing.

## Governance Documents

This section contains key governance documents that outline how CNCF technical groups operate:

### Technical Group Governance

The [Technical Group Governance](tech-group-governance.md) document defines the structure and responsibilities of CNCF technical groups, including:

- **Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs)** - Primary organizational units aligned with industry problem domains
- **Subprojects** - Ongoing projects as part of a TAG or the TOC
- **Initiatives** - Tightly scoped, time-bound work items
- **Community Groups** - Topic-focused groups for knowledge sharing and coordination

### Remediation Process

The [Governance Remediation Process](gov-remediation-process.md) outlines procedures for addressing governance issues and concerns within CNCF technical groups.

### Technical Leadership Principles

The [Technical Leadership Principles Guidance](tech-leadership-principles-guidance.md) provides guidance for technical leaders across CNCF projects and groups.

## Key Principles

CNCF governance is built on several core principles:

- **Transparency** - Open decision-making processes and public documentation
- **Inclusivity** - Welcoming diverse perspectives and backgrounds
- **Meritocracy** - Recognizing and rewarding meaningful contributions
- **Neutrality** - Maintaining vendor-neutral project stewardship
- **Community-Driven** - Empowering the community to drive technical direction
