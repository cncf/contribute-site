# CNCF Governance

The CNCF governance structure establishes the framework for how the foundation operates, makes decisions, and evolves its technical direction. This section provides comprehensive information about governance policies, processes, and principles that guide CNCF projects and community groups.

## Overview

The CNCF governance framework ensures transparent, fair, and effective management of the cloud native ecosystem. It encompasses the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs), subprojects, initiatives, and community groups, all working together to advance cloud native computing.

## Governance Documents

| Document | Description | Audience |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **[Technical Group Governance](./tech-group-governance.md)** | Comprehensive governance framework for TAGs, subprojects, initiatives, and technical community groups | All CNCF maintainers, contributors, and community leaders |
| **[Technical Leadership Principles Guidance](./tech-leadership-principles-guidance.md)** | Guidance on applying CNCF technical leadership principles in practice | TAG chairs, tech leads, and project maintainers |
| **[Governance Remediation Process](./gov-remediation-process.md)** | Process for addressing governance issues and conflicts | TOC members, TAG chairs, and maintainers |

## Key Governance Principles

The CNCF governance structure is built on several foundational principles:

:::tip Core Principles

- **Transparency**: All governance decisions are made in the open with public documentation and discussions
- **Meritocracy**: Leadership positions are earned through technical contribution and community engagement
- **Vendor Neutrality**: No single vendor can control the direction of CNCF projects or groups
- **Community-Driven**: Decisions reflect the needs and input of the broader community
- **Technical Excellence**: Focus on solving real-world problems with high-quality technical solutions

## Governance Structure

The CNCF technical governance operates through four main organizational units:

### Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs)

Primary organizational units aligned with industry problem domains or serving common needs across projects. TAGs provide technical expertise, project evaluation, and ecosystem guidance.

[Learn more about TAGs →](../tags/index.md)

### Subprojects

Ongoing work efforts within TAGs or under the TOC directly, focusing on specific domains such as security assessments, contributor strategy, or project reviews.

### Initiatives

Lightweight, time-bound organizational units for tightly scoped work such as white papers, reports, or specific deliverables.

[Learn more about Initiatives →](../initiatives/index.md)

### Technical Community Groups (TCGs)

Topic or domain-focused groups serving as rallying points for community discussion, knowledge sharing, and coordination of potential future initiatives.
