# CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC)

The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) is the technical governing body of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. The TOC admits and oversees all CNCF projects and has a mandate to facilitate driving neutral consensus for defining and maintaining the technical vision and principles for cloud native computing.

## Overview

The TOC serves as the primary technical decision-making body for the CNCF, ensuring that the foundation's projects and initiatives align with the cloud native mission and principles.

## TOC Responsibilities

The Technical Oversight Committee:

- **Defines and maintains** the technical vision and [principles](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/PRINCIPLES.md) for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation
- **Approves new projects** within the scope of the CNCF set by the Governing Board
- **Creates a conceptual architecture** for CNCF projects, aligning projects, removing or archiving projects
- **Accepts feedback** from the end user technical advisory board and maps it to projects
- **Aligns interfaces** to components under management and defines common practices across CNCF projects
- **Provides technical expertise** during project evaluation and level transitions

## Technical Vision

The technical direction of the ecosystem is problem-centric. The TOC encourages and supports projects to solve problems faced by adopters, build the right ecosystem for innovation, and embrace changes in the broader technical landscape. The goal is to exercise and increase expertise within the technical community to compose solutions that stand the test of time.
