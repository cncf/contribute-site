# TAG Operational Resilience

TAG Operational Resilience is dedicated to developing and promoting best practices for operational resilience, reliability, and availability in cloud native systems. The TAG focuses on observability, chaos engineering, incident response, and related operational practices.

## Mission

The mission of TAG Operational Resilience is to:

- Define and promote best practices for cloud native operational resilience
- Develop frameworks for assessing and improving system reliability
- Foster collaboration between observability, reliability, and operations projects
- Provide guidance on incident management and response
- Promote chaos engineering and resilience testing practices
- Support the development of standards for operational excellence

## Scope

TAG Operational Resilience focuses on:

- Observability (metrics, logs, traces, and profiling)
- Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and error budgets
- Chaos engineering and resilience testing
- Incident management and response
- On-call practices and operational runbooks
- Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices
- Performance optimization and capacity planning
- Service mesh observability
- Distributed tracing and debugging
