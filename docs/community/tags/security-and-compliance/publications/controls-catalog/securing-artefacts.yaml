  title: Build Process Attestation
  objective: Every step in the build process is signed and attested for process integrity
  recommendations:
  - The signing of artefacts should be performed at each stage of its life cycle. The final artefact bundle should include these collective signatures and itself be signed to give integrity to the 
    completed artefact and all its associated metadata.

  title: Build Signature Verification
  objective: Every step in the build process verifies previously generated signatures
  recommendations:
  - The integrity and provenance of images, deployment configuration, and application packages included in artefacts should all be validated using the signatures generated by each step in its build 
    process to ensure compliance

  title: Artifact Signing Framework
  objective: A framework is used to manage signing of artefacts
  recommendations:
  - Consider TUF/notary to sign OCI images. Notary makes use of a “root-of-trust” model to delegate trust from a single root to the individual teams or developers who sign artefacts. It uses 
    additional metadata to allow clients to verify the freshness of content in a repository and protect against common attacks on update systems48. Clients can make use of public keys to verify the 
    contents of the repository.

  title: Attestation Store
  objective: A store is used to manage attestations
  recommendations:
  - Consider storing in-toto attestations in OCI registries alongside the image. Generated in-toto metadata needs to be stored and tracked for which a database or a dedicated store such as Grafeas can
    be used.

  title: Certification Authorization
  objective: Artefacts any given party is authorized to certify are limited
  recommendations:
  - Trust should not be granted universally or indefinitely. Artefacts or metadata that a given party is trusted to certify should be restricted using selective trust delegations. Trust must expire at
    predefined intervals, unless renewed as weel as a party must only be trusted to perform the tasks assigned to it to ensure compartmentatlization

  title: Key Rotation and Revocation
  objective: Rotation and revocation of private keys is supported
  recommendations:
  - The system must be prepared for when, not if, its private keys are compromised. The ability to rotate and revoke private keys must be built into the distribution mechanism. Additionally, multiple 
    keys must be used for different tasks or roles, and a threshold of keys must be required for important roles. Finally, minimal trust must be placed in high-risk keys like those that are stored 
    online or used in automated roles.

  title: OCI Registry Support
  objective: A container registry that supports OCI image-spec images is used
  recommendations:
  - An internal image registry should be deployed and configured to support internal artefact distribution with the security properties described in this section.

  title: Artifact Encryption
  objective: Artefacts are encrypted before distribution and only authorized platforms have decryption capabilities
  recommendations:
  - Ensure contents of the artefact remain confidential in transit and at rest, until it is consumed. These artefacts can be encrypted so that they are accessible by authorized parties, such as the 
    clusters, vulnerability scanners, etc. t is recommended organizations use key management and distribution systems with identity and attestation mechanisms (e.g. SPIFFE/SPIRE)
