# Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog

## Overview

This catalog provides a structured framework for implementing security best practices in cloud-native environments.
It synthesizes the foundational principles of the [Cloud Native Security Whitepaper](../publications/security-whitepaper) and the Software Supply Chain Best Practices Paper into discrete, actionable objectives.

> **Note**: While this catalog is historically called the "Cloud Native Security Controls Catalog," these security objectives are expressed using the term **guidelines**. Throughout this document, we use "guidelines" to refer to the individual security recommendations, while "catalog" refers to the overall collection.

Guidelines are organized into Families, each representing a specific security domain. These families help you navigate and understand the scope of security guidelines across different aspects of cloud native systems.

Each entry contains the following components:
- **ID**: A unique identifier for traceability and mapping.
- **Title**: A short,concise summary of the guideline.
- **Originating Document**: The source publication (e.g., Cloud Native Security Whitepaper v1.0, Software Supply Chain Best Practices v1.0).
- **Objective**: The high-level security goal or intent of the guideline.
- **Guideline Mappings**: Cross-references to frameworks (e.g., NIST SP800-53r5) to indicate compliance alignment.
- **Recommendations**: Practical, non-binding guidance for implementation.
