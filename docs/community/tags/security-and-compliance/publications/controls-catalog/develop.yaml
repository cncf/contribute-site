- id: CNSC-63
  title: Production Environment
  objective: A dedicated production environment is established
  recommendations:
  - Ensure that production workloads are in a separate, dedicated environment from non-production workloads. In the context of containers, this can mean separate clusters. In the case of VMs, separate
    networks.
