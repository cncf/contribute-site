  title: Sensitive Credential Management
  objective: Credentials and keys protecting sensitive workloads (health/finance/etc) are generated and managed independent of a cloud service provider
  recommendations:
  - KMS and HMS are common technologies to achieve this. FIPS 140-2 compliance is strongly suggested. Cloud KMS tends to be FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or greater.
