  title: Secret Commit Prevention
  objective: Secrets are not committed to the source code repository unless encrypted
  recommendations:
  - Implement tooling to detect secrets or to prevent certain files from being pushed which may contain plaintext sensitive materials, such as via a .gitignore and/or .gitattributes file, client-side 
    hook (pre-commit), server-side hook (pre-receive or update), and/or as a step in the CI process

  title: Automated Security Scanning
  objective: Software security scanning and testing is automated
  recommendations:
  - Security specific scans should be performed, including Static Application Security Tests (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Tests (DAST). Both the coverage and results of these tests should 
    be published as part of the repository information to help downstream consumers of software better assess the stability, reliability, and/or suitability of a product or library.

  title: Functional Role Definition
  objective: Roles are defined and aligned to functional responsibilities
  recommendations:
  - Define roles by using principle of least privileges to provide access based on function such as Developer, Maintainer, Owner, Reviewer, Approver, and Guest

  title: Four-Eyes Principle
  objective: An independent four-eyes principle is enforced
  recommendations:
  - The author(s) of a request may not also be the approver of the request. At least two reviewers with equal or greater expertise should review & approve the request.

  title: Branch Protection Rules
  objective: Branch protection rules are used
  recommendations:
  - SCM platforms allow the configuration and restriction of source code operations on individual branches. Protection rules can be used to enforce the usage of pull requests with specified 
    precondition and approval rules, ensuring that a human code review process is followed or an automated status checking of a branch occurs. Additionally, protected branches can be used to disallow 
    dangerous use of force pushes, preventing the overwrite of commit histories and potential obfuscation of code changes.

  title: Key Rotation Policy
  objective: A key rotation policy is maintained
  recommendations:
  - It is recommended to implement a key rotation policy to ensure that compromised keys will cease to be usable after a certain period of time. When a private key is known to have been compromised, 
    it should be revoked and replaced immediately to shut off access for any unauthorized user. Organizations may also consider using short lived certificates or keys, which reduces the reliance on 
    certificate revocation systems.

  title: Ephemeral Credentials
  objective: Short-lived or ephemeral credentials are used for machine and service access
  recommendations:
  - Short-life credential issuance encourages the use of fine grained permissions and automation in provisioning access tokens. For CI/CD pipeline agents, short-lived access tokens should be 
    considered instead of password-based credentials. The use of very short-lived tokens like OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, etc., will help to implement more secure access and increase the security 
    assurance.
