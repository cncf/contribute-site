  title: Third-Party Artifact Verification
  objective: Third party artefacts and open source libraries are verified
  recommendations:
  - All third party artefacts, open source libraries and any other dependencies should be verified as part of the continuous integration pipeline by validating their checksums against a known good 
    source and validating any cryptographic signatures. Any software ingested must be scanned using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and pentesting tools to detect whether any vulnerable 
    open-source software is used in the final product.

  title: Source-Based Library Builds
  objective: Libraries are built based upon source code

  applicability:
  - SSCP-v1.0

  title: Trusted Package Sources
  objective: Trusted package managers and repositories are defined and prioritized
  recommendations:
  - Organizations should host their own package managers and artefact repositories, and restrict build machines to pull from only those sources.

  title: Third-Party SBOM Requirements
  objective: SBOM is required from third party suppliers
  recommendations:
  - Where possible, vendors should be required to provide Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) containing the explicit details of the software and versions used within the supplied product as it 
    provides a clear and direct link to the dependencies.

  title: Immutable SBOM Generation
  objective: An immutable SBOM of the code is generated
  recommendations:

  title: Dependency Tracking
  objective: Dependencies between open source components are tracked
  recommendations:
  - A register should be maintained of a project’s open source components, dependencies and vulnerabilities to help trace any deployed artefacts with new vulnerabilities. One of the most popular open 
    source inventory implementations is OWASP Dependency-Track.

  title: License Compliance Scanning
  objective: Software is scanned for license implications
  recommendations:
  - Licensing obligations must also be factored into the ingestion process. The Linux Foundation maintains the Open Compliance Program36 which hosts several tools to ensure released software meets 
    legal and regulatory compliance requirements.

  title: Software Composition Analysis
  objective: Software composition analysis is run on ingested software
  recommendations:
  - The SCA tool will attempt to use heuristics to identify the direct and transitive dependencies, and can also serve as verification of SBOM content. This data will then be matched against data from
    a number of data feeds containing vulnerability data to highlight any vulnerabilities in the dependent packages.
