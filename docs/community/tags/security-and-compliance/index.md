## Focus Areas

TAG Security and Compliance works on several key security domains:

### Security Hygiene

Best practices for maintaining secure cloud native systems:

- **Security Posture**: Assessing and improving security baseline
- **Vulnerability Management**: Identifying and remediating vulnerabilities
- **Patch Management**: Keeping systems updated and secure
- **Configuration Security**: Hardening configurations across the stack
- **Access Control**: Identity, authentication, and authorization

### Policy-as-Code

Defining and enforcing policies programmatically:

- **Policy Languages**: OPA/Rego, Kyverno, and other policy frameworks
- **Admission Control**: Enforcing policies at deployment time
- **Runtime Policies**: Enforcing policies during execution
- **Policy Libraries**: Reusable policy templates and best practices
- **Policy Testing**: Validating policies before deployment

### Compliance

Meeting regulatory and industry requirements:

- **Compliance Frameworks**: NIST, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated compliance checking and reporting
- **Audit Trails**: Maintaining comprehensive audit logs
- **Compliance as Code**: Managing compliance requirements programmatically
- **Continuous Compliance**: Ongoing compliance monitoring

### Auditing

Monitoring and recording security-relevant activities:

- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events
- **Log Analysis**: Detecting anomalies and security incidents
- **Forensics**: Investigating security incidents
- **Compliance Audits**: Supporting external audit requirements
- **Audit Tools**: Tooling for audit collection and analysis

### Threat Modeling

Identifying and mitigating security threats:

- **Attack Surface Analysis**: Understanding potential attack vectors
- **Threat Intelligence**: Staying informed about emerging threats
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluating and prioritizing security risks
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Implementing controls to reduce risks
- **Security Architecture**: Designing secure systems from the ground up

### Secure Software Supply Chain

Protecting the software supply chain:

- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials generation and management
- **Artifact Signing**: Cryptographic signing of software artifacts
- **Provenance**: Tracking the origin and build process of software
- **Dependency Security**: Managing third-party dependencies securely
- **Build Security**: Securing the software build pipeline

## Subprojects
