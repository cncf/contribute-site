# CNCF Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs)

Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) are the primary organizational units within the CNCF that oversee and coordinate interests across projects, working groups, and the broader cloud native community. TAGs scale technical contributions while maintaining quality and advancing the CNCF mission of making cloud native computing ubiquitous.

## Overview

TAGs serve as bridges between CNCF projects, end users, and the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). Each TAG focuses on a specific industry problem domain or provides horizontal services that support other TAGs and projects.

:::tip TAG Mission

TAGs strengthen the project ecosystem to meet the needs of end users and contributors by:

- Providing technical expertise during project evaluations
- Identifying gaps in the CNCF project portfolio
- Educating users with unbiased, practical information
- Fostering project maturity across the ecosystem
- Serving as a bridge between projects to surface common problems

:::

## Current TAGs

The CNCF has five active Technical Advisory Groups organized by domain:

## TAG Structure and Organization

Each TAG operates with a consistent structure:

| Role | Count | Term | Responsibilities |
|------|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Chairs** | 3 | 2 years | Oversee planning and execution, ensure adherence to principles, report to TOC |
| **Tech Leads** | 5-6 | 2 years | Provide subject matter expertise, guide technical decisions, maintain quality |
| **Subprojects** | Variable | Ongoing | Focused work efforts on specific domains |
| **Initiatives** | Variable | Time-bound | Short-term deliverables like white papers or reports |

### How TAGs Operate

TAGs follow a consistent operational model:

- **Regular Meetings**: At least one public monthly meeting, recorded and uploaded to YouTube
- **Open Participation**: All meetings are open to the community
- **Documented Decisions**: All significant decisions documented publicly
- **Progress Updates**: Regular reports to the TOC on health, subprojects, and initiatives
- **Community Engagement**: KubeCon presence, blog posts, white papers, and presentations

## Getting Involved with TAGs

TAGs welcome participation from anyone in the cloud native community:

### Attend Meetings

All TAG meetings are open to the public. No registration or membership required - simply join and observe or participate in discussions.

### Join Communication Channels

- **Slack**: Each TAG has a dedicated Slack channel (links above)
- **Mailing Lists**: Subscribe to TAG mailing lists for announcements and discussions
- **GitHub**: Watch TAG repositories for issues and pull requests

### Contribute to Work

- **Review Documents**: Provide feedback on white papers, best practices, and other outputs
- **Participate in Initiatives**: Join time-bound work efforts that interest you
- **Help with Reviews**: Assist with project evaluations and health checks
- **Share Expertise**: Contribute domain knowledge to discussions and deliverables

### Path to Leadership

TAGs actively mentor future leaders:

1. **Start Contributing**: Participate in meetings, discussions, and initiatives
2. **Take on Tasks**: Volunteer for specific deliverables or responsibilities
3. **Build Expertise**: Develop deep knowledge in the TAG's domain
4. **Get Nominated**: Chairs nominate Tech Leads; community elects Chairs
5. **Apply Experience**: Prior CNCF community activity is valued

## TAG Requirements

All TAGs must maintain certain standards:

:::info Core Requirements

- **Charter**: Documented scope, overlaps, and operational guidelines
- **Metadata**: Current list of leads, subprojects, and initiatives
- **Public Meetings**: At least one monthly meeting, recorded and published
- **Regular Updates**: Periodic health reports to the TOC
- **Project Reviews**: Timely participation in project evaluation processes
- **Community Engagement**: KubeCon presence and ecosystem updates

:::

## Relationship with Other Groups

TAGs coordinate with multiple parts of the CNCF ecosystem:

- **TOC**: TAGs report to and receive direction from the TOC
- **Projects**: TAGs provide expertise and support to CNCF projects
- **Subprojects**: TAGs may form subprojects for ongoing work
- **Initiatives**: TAGs sponsor time-bound initiatives for specific deliverables
- **TCGs**: Technical Community Groups may evolve into TAGs over time
- **End Users**: TAGs gather feedback and provide guidance to adopters

## Historical Context

The current TAG structure was established in 2025 to better align with cloud native ecosystem needs. Previous Technical Advisory Groups are being phased out and replaced with this new structure.

:::note Legacy TAGs

The following legacy TAGs are being spun down during 2025:

- TAG Security → TAG Security and Compliance
- TAG Storage → TAG Infrastructure
- TAG App Delivery → TAG Developer Experience
- TAG Network → TAG Infrastructure
- TAG Runtime → TAG Workloads Foundation
- TAG Contributor Strategy → TOC Subproject: Contributor Strategy and Advocacy
- TAG Observability → TAG Operational Resilience
- TAG Environmental Sustainability → TAG Operational Resilience
