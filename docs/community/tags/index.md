# CNCF Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs)

Technical Advisory Groups (TAGs) are the primary organizational units within CNCF that coordinate interests and work pertaining to specific technical domains. TAGs scale contributions by the CNCF technical and user community while maintaining integrity and quality in support of CNCF's mission to make cloud native ubiquitous.

## What are TAGs?

TAGs are long-lived groups that report directly to the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC). Each TAG:

- Oversees and coordinates interests in a logical area of cloud native computing
- Facilitates collaboration between projects, end users, and the broader community
- Produces artifacts such as whitepapers, reference architectures, and best practices
- Sponsors initiatives and subprojects within their domain
- Provides technical guidance and leadership in their specialty area

## Current TAGs

CNCF currently has five active Technical Advisory Groups:

### TAG Developer Experience

**Focus**: Improving the developer experience in cloud native environments

TAG Developer Experience works to understand and improve the experience of developers working with cloud native technologies. This includes tools, workflows, and practices that make it easier to build, deploy, and maintain cloud native applications.

**Resources**:
- [TAG Developer Experience Home](developer-experience/index.md)

### TAG Infrastructure

**Focus**: Core cloud native infrastructure development and best practices

TAG Infrastructure develops and promotes practices, standards, and assessments for core cloud native infrastructure areas, enabling systems, applications, and architectures that are scalable, resilient, secure, and performant.

**Resources**:
- [TAG Infrastructure Home](infrastructure/index.md)

### TAG Operational Resilience

**Focus**: Operational resilience and reliability practices

TAG Operational Resilience is dedicated to developing and promoting best practices for operational resilience, reliability, and availability in cloud native systems. This includes observability, chaos engineering, incident response, and related practices.

**Resources**:
- [TAG Operational Resilience Home](operational-resilience/index.md)

### TAG Security and Compliance

**Focus**: Security and compliance in cloud native systems

TAG Security and Compliance addresses security and compliance concerns across the cloud native ecosystem. The TAG produces security assessments, whitepapers, best practices, and tools to help secure cloud native systems.

**Resources**:
- [TAG Security and Compliance Home](security-and-compliance/index.md)

### TAG Workloads Foundation

**Focus**: Foundation for cloud native workloads and applications

TAG Workloads Foundation focuses on the development and standardization of cloud native workloads and applications. This includes application patterns, runtime environments, and foundational technologies.

**Resources**:
- [TAG Workloads Foundation Home](workloads-foundation/index.md)

## TAG Structure

Each TAG typically has:

- **Chairs** (2-3): Lead the TAG, coordinate meetings, and serve as primary liaisons to the TOC
- **Tech Leads** (2-3): Provide technical direction and oversee technical initiatives
- **TOC Liaison(s)**: One or more TOC members who facilitate communication with the TOC
- **Contributors**: Community members who participate in TAG activities

## Getting Involved

### Attend TAG Meetings

All TAG meetings are open to the public. Each TAG maintains its own meeting schedule:

- Meeting schedules are published on the [CNCF Public Calendar](https://www.cncf.io/calendar/)
- Meeting notes and recordings are available in each TAG's GitHub repository
- Agenda items can be submitted via GitHub issues or during meetings

### Join a TAG

To join a TAG:

1. Visit the TAG's page (linked above) to find their communication channels
2. Join their Slack channel and mailing list
3. Attend meetings and introduce yourself
4. Review current initiatives and find areas where you can contribute
5. Read the TAG's charter and governance documents

### Contribute

TAGs welcome contributions in many forms:

- Participate in discussions and provide feedback
- Contribute to whitepapers, specifications, and documentation
- Lead or contribute to initiatives within the TAG
- Help with project assessments and due diligence
- Present on relevant topics at TAG meetings

## TAG Governance

TAGs operate under the [CNCF Technical Group Governance](../governance/tech-group-governance.md) framework. Key aspects include:

- **Formation**: TAGs are created by TOC vote based on community need
- **Leadership**: TAG Chairs and Tech Leads serve fixed terms and are elected by TAG contributors
- **Scope**: Each TAG has a clearly defined charter outlining its scope and responsibilities
- **Reporting**: TAGs report to the TOC monthly on their activities and progress

## Communication

### Cross-TAG Communication

- **Mailing List**: [cncf-tag-chairs@lists.cncf.io](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-tag-chairs)
- **Slack**: Individual TAG channels on [CNCF Slack](https://cloud-native.slack.com)
- **Meetings**: TAG Chairs meet regularly to coordinate cross-TAG efforts

### General TAG Information

For general questions about TAGs:

- Open an issue in the [CNCF TOC repository](https://github.com/cncf/toc)
- Ask in the `#toc` channel on CNCF Slack
- Email the TOC at [cncf-toc@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-toc@lists.cncf.io)
