# TAG Workloads Foundation

TAG Workloads Foundation focuses on the development and standardization of cloud native workloads and applications. The TAG addresses application patterns, runtime environments, and foundational technologies that support cloud native workloads.

## Mission

The mission of TAG Workloads Foundation is to:

- Define and promote patterns for cloud native workloads
- Develop standards for application portability and interoperability
- Foster collaboration between workload-focused projects
- Provide guidance on application architecture and design
- Support the development of workload specifications and APIs
- Promote best practices for building and running cloud native applications

## Scope

TAG Workloads Foundation focuses on:

- Application runtime environments
- Workload specification and definition
- Application portability across platforms
- Stateful and stateless application patterns
- Application lifecycle management
- Batch and job processing workloads
- Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and serverless
- WebAssembly (Wasm) and edge workloads
- Application composition and packaging
