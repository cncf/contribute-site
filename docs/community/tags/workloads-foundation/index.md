# TAG Workloads Foundation

TAG Workloads Foundation defines and advances practices and standards for fundamental cloud native workload execution environments and their related lifecycle management within cloud native systems, applications, and architectures.

## Mission Statement

To define and advance practices and standards for fundamental cloud native workload execution environments and their related lifecycle management within cloud native systems, applications, and architectures. This supports the CNCF's technical vision by addressing critical problems faced by adopters and contributing to a robust cloud native ecosystem.
