# CNCF Initiatives

Initiatives are lightweight organizational units used for TAG or TOC work. They are tightly scoped and time-bound, with specific outputs and deliverables. Initiatives provide a flexible way to accomplish focused work without the overhead of permanent organizational structures.

## What are Initiatives?

According to the [CNCF Technical Group Governance](../governance/tech-group-governance.md), initiatives are:

- **Tightly Scoped** - Focused on specific, well-defined outcomes
- **Time-Bound** - Have clear start and end dates or completion criteria
- **Output-Oriented** - Produce concrete deliverables (whitepapers, tools, standards, etc.)
- **Flexible** - Can be formed and dissolved as needed

## Types of Initiatives

### TAG Initiatives

TAG Initiatives are sponsored by a specific Technical Advisory Group and focus on work within that TAG's scope. Examples include:

- Developing a whitepaper on a specific technology or practice
- Creating a reference architecture or implementation guide
- Conducting a landscape analysis of tools in a domain
- Producing a best practices guide

### Subproject Initiatives

Subproject Initiatives are work items within a TAG's subproject. They follow similar patterns but are scoped to the subproject's domain.

### TOC Initiatives

TOC Initiatives are sponsored directly by the Technical Oversight Committee and address cross-cutting concerns or strategic work. Examples include:

- Process improvements for project evaluation
- Cross-TAG coordination efforts
- Ecosystem-wide standards development
- Community health initiatives

## Initiative Lifecycle

### Formation

1. **Proposal** - A TAG, subproject, or TOC member proposes an initiative
2. **Scope Definition** - Clear objectives, deliverables, and timeline are defined
3. **Approval** - The sponsoring group (TAG, subproject, or TOC) approves the initiative
4. **Team Formation** - Contributors are identified and roles assigned

### Execution

1. **Regular Updates** - Progress is reported to the sponsoring group
2. **Community Engagement** - Work is done openly with community participation
3. **Iteration** - Scope may be adjusted based on feedback and progress
4. **Deliverable Development** - Concrete outputs are produced

### Completion

1. **Deliverable Review** - Final outputs are reviewed by the sponsoring group
2. **Publication** - Deliverables are published and announced to the community
3. **Archive** - Initiative materials are archived for reference
4. **Closure** - The initiative is formally closed

## Initiative Artifacts

The outputs of initiatives can be found in several places:

- **TAG Repositories** - Most initiative outputs are published in the relevant TAG's GitHub repository
- **TOC Repository** - TOC initiative outputs are published in the [CNCF TOC repository](https://github.com/cncf/toc)
- **CNCF Resources** - Major deliverables may be published on CNCF websites
- **Initiative Folders** - Some TAGs maintain dedicated folders for initiative artifacts

Initiatives are tracked in the repositories of their sponsoring groups:
