## Intent and Purpose

The core purpose of the Project Pavilion is to serve as a **direct means for attendees to interact with CNCF Projects**. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) hosts [many open source projects](https://landscape.cncf.io), and the Pavilion ensures attendees get a chance to check out each one.

The Pavilion is structured as a rallying point for CNCF Maintainers and Ambassadors, aiming to create a mix of creators, consumers, and advocates—all operating with their “upstream hats” on. Instead of commercial activities, the Pavilion is an open invitation for everyone to actively participate in open source so that they can *understand* how open source works. It has been likened to a farmer’s market, but for software.

For the projects themselves, the Pavilion is their chance to show off the things they work on and share, and to provide introductory material to attendees.

## What the Pavilion Offers Attendees 

The Project Pavilion offers numerous benefits for attendees, whether they are new to KubeCon or seasoned cloud native professionals. That's you!

### Direct Access to Open Source Experts

*   **Q&A and Interaction:** The Pavilion is the place where attendees can get their Q&A with projects during the conference. Projects have booths and shifts, so attendees should check on them every day, as the landscape is rapidly changing. 
*   **A Live R&D Lab:** For end users, the Pavilion offers a glimpse into the lab where they can check in on the projects they depend on and support. They can also **dip their toes into the CNCF Sandbox** to see the newest experimental projects.
*   **Deep Diving:** If you are technically minded and want direct access to CNCF Contributors, the Pavilion is where you need to be to get right into the weeds. There is plenty of space and power for focused hacking or simply hanging out and getting to know fellow community members.

### Learning and Guidance

*   **First Time?:** KubeCon can be overwhelming, especially for new attendees. The Pavilion is a great place for first-timers to start their journey and, by interacting directly with projects and maintainers, get a grasp of the big picture.
*   **Ambassador Tours:** CNCF Ambassadors are usually close by to help guide attendees. Tours are run daily (Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday), including a “safari tour” of the CNCF Landscape. These tours provide attendees with guidance and help them connect with important projects and people.
*   **Maintainer Demos and Unconference:** The revamped Pavilion includes an entire stage with screens and plenty of seating. This stage is exclusively for CNCF Maintainers to run additional demos and talks throughout the day, often featuring a demo every 20 minutes. The stage purposely runs as an unconference, allowing attendees to experience maintainers speaking passionately about their projects "live".
*   **Ecosystem Lens:** The ultimate hope is that attendees see the Pavilion as a lens right into the cloud native ecosystem, encouraging them not just to observe but to participate and meet the people who are waiting to work with them.

### Resources and Comfort

*   **CNCF Staff Services:** CNCF staff always be working out of the Pavilion. This location is excellent for projects to sync up with CNCF project services to discuss topics like:
    *   LFX Insights
    *   Conformance Programs
    *   Training Programs
    *   Mentorship Programs
    *   Technical Writing
    *   Getting set up on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
    *   Anything related to a KubeCon booth
*   **Conference Break Spot:** If you need a break or your feet hurt, you should come hang out. The Pavilion is ideally positioned in the middle of the show floor. It offers the **most luxurious couches in the entire Conference Center** and is the building’s comfortable break area.
*   **Amenities:** The Pavilion is close to **caffeine** and the bathrooms. The **hugely popular sticker dispensers** are always nearby!
