# CNCF Maintainer Summit

The CNCF Maintainer Summit is an **exclusive event for the people behind our projects** to gather face-to-face, collaborate, and celebrate the projects that make “Cloud Native”.

Programming is focused on sharing best practices, diving into contributing processes, and solving common problems across projects to enrich our great community of maintainers. The goal is to make the CNCF ecosystem stronger and better by helping maintainers become stronger working together.

## Who Can Attend (Eligibility)

The Maintainer Summit is **not an event for general attendance**. Attendance is limited to ensure active engagement due to limited space and the rapidly growing number of CNCF Project Org members.

### Eligible Attendees

*   **Sandbox Project Maintainers**
    *   *Note: Your GitHub handle MUST exist in the official `project-maintainers.csv` file.*
*   **Incubating Project Org Members**
*   **Graduated Project Org Members**
*   **CNCF TOC Members**
*   **CNCF TAG Chairs, Technical Leads and Working Group Leads**

### Registration Requirements

To attend the Maintainer Summit, **you must be registered for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon**. A single-day Maintainer Summit-only pass is **not** available.

Registration status will be placed into a pending queue for weekly review by CNCF staff to validate criteria compliance.

### Sponsored Attendees

Maintainers, TAG Leads, K8s SIG Leads, or WG Leads can sponsor someone who is not yet a GitHub org member to attend. If sponsoring an attendee, the sponsor must proactively contact `ProjectsAtKubeCon@linuxfoundation.org` with the individual’s details.

## Program and Content

The summit program includes curated content chosen via a formal CFP process, as well as community-driven unconference sessions.

### Unconference Sessions

The unconference is a fundamental part of the summit, where **attendees are in the driver’s seat**.

*   **Format:** Attendees pick the topics they want to discuss. These meetings are unstructured, and any resulting action items are driven and owned by the participants.
*   **Proposing Topics:** If you missed the formal CFP deadline, the majority of the summit format allows for unconference-style sessions, giving you an opportunity to propose a session closer to the event. Attendees can vote on the topics they wish to discuss.
*   **Recording:** Unconference sessions are generally **not recorded** due to their discussion-oriented nature. Attendees are encouraged to keep shared notes documents.

### Project Meetings

Space is available for project teams to book rooms and have dedicated project meetings.

### Key Governance Topics and Initiatives

The summit provides opportunities to understand how the CNCF (TOC and TAGs) supports maintainer work.

*   **TOC & Steering Committee:** There are opportunities, such as "Ask the Experts" sessions, to interface directly with the TOC and the Kubernetes Steering Committee.
*   **Tag Reboot Initiative:** There will be dedicated sessions focusing on the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) reboot initiative. This initiative seeks to restructure TAGs, address leadership availability/burnout, and look for new domain experts and contributions.
*   **Future Leadership:** We are currently looking for **Program Chairs for future Maintainer Summits** (specifically 2026 and 2027). If you are interested in this role—which involves organizing content and working with the events team—please reach out.

## Call for Proposals (CFP) and Speaking

### CFP Eligibility (for submitting talks)

*   Incubating Project GitHub Org Members
*   Graduated Project GitHub Org Members
*   CNCF TAG Leads & the CNCF TOC

### Speaker Registration Benefits

Accepted speakers who submitted via the CFP process will receive an **“All-Access” pass** for CNCF-hosted co-located events and KubeCon + CloudNativeCon programming. (This excludes proposals submitted for Project Meetings).

*Note: Leaders of unconference sessions do not receive complimentary registration.*

### CFP Timeline (Context from previous summit planning)

To ensure high-quality content, the CFP process is formalized and rigorous. The timeline for the upcoming North America summit was extended (opening May 19th and running until the end of July) to avoid holidays and short deadlines previously experienced by the community.
