# CNCF Maintainer Summit

The CNCF Maintainer Summit is an **exclusive event for the people behind our projects** to gather face-to-face, collaborate, and celebrate the projects that make “Cloud Native”.

Programming is focused on sharing best practices, diving into contributing processes, and solving common problems across projects to enrich our great community of maintainers. The goal is to make the CNCF ecosystem stronger and better by helping maintainers become stronger working together.

The Maintainer Summit is **not an event for general attendance**. Attendance is limited to ensure active engagement due to limited space and the rapidly growing number of CNCF Project Org members.

### Eligible Attendees

*   **Sandbox Project Maintainers**
    *   *Note: Your GitHub handle MUST exist in the official [`project-maintainers.csv`](https://github.com/cncf/project-maintainers/blob/main/project-maintainers.csv) file (located in the CNCF GitHub organization). You can verify your inclusion by checking this file for your GitHub handle.*

*   **CNCF TOC Members**
*   **CNCF TAG Chairs, Technical Leads and Working Group Leads**

To attend the Maintainer Summit, **you must be registered for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon**. A single-day Maintainer Summit-only pass is **not** available.

Registration status will be placed into a pending queue for weekly review by CNCF staff to validate criteria compliance.

## Program and Content

The summit program includes curated content chosen via a formal CFP process, as well as community-driven unconference sessions.

### Unconference Sessions

The unconference is a fundamental part of the summit, where **attendees are in the driver’s seat**.

*   **Format:** Attendees pick the topics they want to discuss. These meetings are unstructured, and any resulting action items are driven and owned by the participants.
*   **Proposing Topics:** If you missed the formal CFP deadline, the majority of the summit format allows for unconference-style sessions, giving you an opportunity to propose a session closer to the event. Attendees can vote on the topics they wish to discuss.
*   **Recording:** Unconference sessions are generally **not recorded** due to their discussion-oriented nature. Attendees are encouraged to keep shared notes documents.

### Project Meetings

Space is available for project teams to book rooms and have dedicated project meetings.

### Key Governance Topics and Initiatives

The summit provides opportunities to understand how the CNCF (TOC and TAGs) supports maintainer work.

*   **TOC & Steering Committee:** There are opportunities, such as "Ask the Experts" sessions, to interface directly with the TOC and the Kubernetes Steering Committee.
*   **TAG Reboot Initiative:** Dedicated sessions will focus on the CNCF-wide effort to restructure and revitalize Technical Advisory Groups, aiming to improve leadership sustainability, address burnout, and attract new domain experts and contributors. For more details, see the [TAG Reboot Initiative overview](https://github.com/cncf/tag-reboot) or the [CNCF blog post](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/03/01/announcing-the-cncf-tag-reboot-initiative/).
*   **Future Leadership:** We are currently looking for **Program Chairs for future Maintainer Summits** (specifically 2026 and 2027). If you are interested in this role—which involves organizing content and working with the events team—please reach out.
