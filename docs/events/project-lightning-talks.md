The Project Lightning Talks event at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (KCCNC) is designed to serve as a **warm up** and a **good primer** for the main conference.

### Timing and Purpose

The lightning talks take place the **day before** KubeCon starts. They are typically scheduled right after registration. During the talks, the show floor is closed.

The talks are strongly recommended for **new attendees**, especially since over 50% of recent KubeCon attendees are brand new. Their purpose is to help attendees get a feel for the projects and figure out what they are going to do this week before the show floor opens. They provide a sampling, flavor, or taste of the conference offerings.

### Format and Atmosphere

*   **Presentation Style:** Each project gives a **7 minute presentation**. The lightning talks run continuously ("in perpetuity until we fall over"), with a new talk from a project starting every seven minutes.
*   **Duration and Flexibility:** The talks run all day, allowing attendees to dip in and out at any time. The session is designed to have chill vibes (or "chillops"), meaning attendees do not have to commit to a time slot. If attendees are not enjoying a talk, they are free to leave and return later.
*   **Content:** Most of the talks focus on open source projects. They encourage attendees to seek more information later at the Project Pavilion once the show floor is open.

### Hosts and Theme

The event is hosted by fabulous hosts from the Cloud Native Community. The hosts manage the introduction and cover the content via the theme, **“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the CNCF Landscape”**. This session aims to help attendees navigate the "highly intimidating map of all of these projects" known as the CNCF Landscape. Attendees are encouraged to note any projects that "vibe" with them so they can visit them later in the Project Pavilion.
