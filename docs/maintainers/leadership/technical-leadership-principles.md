### Purpose

The Technical Oversight Committee has adopted these leadership principles to help guide the ecosystem in growth and maturity. These principles define the expectations of TOC members, project maintainers, TAG Chairs and Leads, chairs and leads of any group or committee, and other persons serving in any leadership role in the CNCF community.


### Principles

Our goal with these is to foster a more inclusive and welcoming community for all, and we expect all leaders in the CNCF community  to participate in accordance with these principles. If a leader is not acting in accordance with these principles, community members should first address it with the other leaders of the project, TAG, committee, group, or body. Project and TAG governance documentation must explain procedures (including who is responsible) for response and resolution if these principles are not being followed. In general, if a leader is not following these principles, there should be a good faith effort to educate, inform, and provide the leader with an opportunity to improve before taking further action such as suspending or removing them from their leadership role. If the behavior that violates these principles persists, or if the other leaders of the applicable project, committee, or group do not take corrective action in response to a reported violation of these principles, projects should escalate the matter to the TOC.
In addition to adhering to these principles, all leaders must adhere to the CNCF Code of Conduct.

These leadership principles are in addition to the TOC Operating Principles, shown above.

### Be welcoming

Make a conscious effort to be welcoming in your interactions. If someone is new, express sincere interest in what brought them to the group. Check in with existing contributors to ensure they continue to feel welcome. Create space for new contributors and existing contributors to be curious and engaged with the work that we do in cloud native by building on common interests and outcomes.

### Provide feedback and appreciation appropriately

Provide praise, gratitude, appreciation and encouragement in public. Look for opportunities to say “thank you” and recognize people when they are being helpful or making contributions. Be specific in what was done and describe the impact it had or continues to have.
If you have negative or constructive feedback about an individual or group, provide it in a form that is meaningful and actionable in private, ideally with support from a neutral third-party. Having another individual present that serves as a neutral participant can assist in removing biased power dynamics or asymmetry in the discussion. Constructive feedback should be specific, with a recommended alternative, solution, or suggestion for improvement. If possible, make an effort to find out how the individual or group would like to receive feedback; not everyone is comfortable receiving feedback in person or over a virtual meeting, and ensure they are accepting of a neutral participant to support an engaging feedback conversation while providing a transparent and equitable process.
Be gracious, courteous, and kind in how you provide feedback and how you receive feedback from others.

### Always do better

Identify and give opportunities to improve while considering how feedback might be perceived by someone receiving it. Request from others and self-identify areas in your own interactions that could be improved and take steps to make those changes. Make a conscious effort to effect change in your own behaviors and be the model of that effort for others to strive towards.

### Lead inclusively and empower all voices and opinions to be heard

Actively seek to engage a variety of different voices and opinions as our community is built off a wide group of perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. We are better as a community when we engage with all of the breadth of cloud native to better understand one another. As leaders, we are responsible for enabling everyone to not only have the opportunity to not only be engaged, but to bring balance to the discussions so no single voice - or perspective - overruns the desires of the collective whole.
For example, make an extra effort to ask the person who is new or who hasn’t yet spoken up in a meeting if they have any comments to offer. Make conscious effort to facilitate discussions in a manner that allows all voices to be heard and included, not just the loudest or most opinionated voices. Be aware that people who are shy, introverted, from historically underrepresented groups, and from certain cultures may be hesitant to speak up unless you clearly invite them to offer their opinion. Thus, make that extra effort to include people. Be sure to give everyone who wants to express their perspective an opportunity to offer their opinions even if they are not present in meetings. Invite people to continue sharing feedback asynchronously after meetings via Github, slack, or another channel that all participants have access to so they have the opportunity to provide comment.

### Foster respectful resolution

Handle disagreements respectfully. Seek to resolve conflict and disagreement in a respectful and collaborative manner and encourage others to do the same. Show empathy, care, and concern for others’ feelings, perspectives, and experiences while working towards a resolution that considers the Community, the projects we interact with, the mission of our work, and what can reasonably be accomplished with consensus in accordance with the project's governance and scope. Conflict and disagreement will happen, as leaders we must de-escalate, be the agent of calm, and provide neutrality for all parties to feel welcome in expressing their perspectives while pursuing an acceptable outcome.

### Facilitate open, transparent, and inclusive decision-making

Although it is perfectly acceptable to discuss ideas, proposals, and agendas with other participants in private conversations, decisions of any official community group, committee, project, or governing body should be made in an open and transparent manner, in accordance with that body’s governance rules, and the reasoning or basis for such decision should be clearly documented. This not only allows others to understand the why, but also may serve as the basis of future discussions and activities that resulted from that decision and provide the opportunity to change it should circumstances change.
