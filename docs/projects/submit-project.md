The primary entry point into the CNCF is through the [Sandbox application process](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox). On rare occasions, projects can apply directly to Incubation. In any case, applications, reviews, and onboarding steps follow the same steps.

The [application form](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/new?template=application.yml) explains what's required for projects that want to join the CNCF. The [onboarding template](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/project-onboarding.md) provides an overview of what projects need to do to fully integrate into the CNCF community after the TOC votes to accept the project.
