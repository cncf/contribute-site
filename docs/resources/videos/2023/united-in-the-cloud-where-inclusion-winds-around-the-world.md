In this keynote, Nikhita will highlight how the cloud native community has evolved over time, challenges faced by contributors from around the world and how we can build a vibrant home that embraces all voices. Just as the Chicago River flows through the heart of the city, inclusion weaves through the fabric of cloud native development, playing a major role in sparking innovation and strengthening the community's collective identity.

In the Windy City and beyond, the contributions of these global stewards are key to cloud nativeâ€™s success. Through this keynote, learn more about how to best support them and address the evolving needs of users and contributors worldwide.
